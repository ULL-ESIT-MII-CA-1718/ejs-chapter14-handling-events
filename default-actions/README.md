Many events have a default action associated with them. 
*If you click
a link, you will be taken to the link’s target. 
* If you press the
down arrow, the browser will scroll the page down. 
* If you right-click,
you’ll get a context menu. And so on.

Depending on the browser, some events can’t be intercepted. On
Chrome, for example, keyboard shortcuts to close the current tab
(Ctrl-W or Command-W) cannot be handled by JavaScript.
