<h2><a class=h_ident id="h_HQoLxG2r2l" href="#h_HQoLxG2r2l"></a>Event handlers</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_4crjoEGjCE" href="#p_4crjoEGjCE"></a>Imagine an interface where the
only way to find out whether a key on the keyboard is being pressed is to read the
current state of that key. To be able to react to keypresses,
you would have to constantly read the key&#8217;s state so that
you&#8217;d catch it before it&#8217;s released again. It would be dangerous to
perform other time-intensive computations since you might miss a
keypress.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_gL+2BzAZqa" href="#p_gL+2BzAZqa"></a>That is how such input was handled on primitive machines. A step
up would be for the hardware or operating system to notice the
keypress and put it in a queue. A program can then periodically check the
queue for new events and react to what it finds there.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_llZbht+m+p" href="#p_llZbht+m+p"></a>Of course, it has to remember
to look at the queue, and to do it often, because any time between the
key being pressed and the program noticing the event will cause the
software to feel unresponsive. This approach is called <em>polling</em>.
Most programmers avoid it whenever possible.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_yR0Vf6qqc8" href="#p_yR0Vf6qqc8"></a>A better mechanism is for
the underlying system to give our code a chance to react
to events as they occur. Browsers do this by allowing us to register
functions as <em>handlers</em> for specific events.</p>

<p><a class=p_ident id="p_MOjheGCW5Y" href="#p_MOjheGCW5Y"></a>The <code>addEventListener</code>
function registers its second argument to be called whenever the event
described by its first argument occurs.</p>

<h2><a class=h_ident id="h_NEhx0cDpml" href="#h_NEhx0cDpml"></a>Propagation</h2>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_AMEe+Oabfh" href="#p_AMEe+Oabfh"></a>Event handlers registered on
nodes with children will also receive some events that happen in the
children. If a button inside a paragraph is clicked, event handlers on
the paragraph will also receive the click event.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_UBfEVzqY/E" href="#p_UBfEVzqY/E"></a>But if both the paragraph and the button have a
handler, the more specific handler—the one on the button—gets to go
first. The event is said to <em>propagate</em> outward, from the node where
it happened to that node&#8217;s parent node and on to the root of the
document. Finally, after all handlers registered on a specific node
have had their turn, handlers registered on the whole window get a
chance to respond to the event.</p>
<p><a class=p_ident id="p_mgXPeV1qcP" href="#p_mgXPeV1qcP"></a>At any point, an event
handler can call the <code>stopPropagation</code> method on the event object to
prevent handlers “further up” from receiving the event. This can be
useful when, for example, you have a button inside another clickable
element and you don&#8217;t want clicks on the button to activate the outer
element&#8217;s click behavior.</p>
