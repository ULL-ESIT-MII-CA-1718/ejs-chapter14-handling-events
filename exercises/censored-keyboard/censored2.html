Between 1928
and 2013, Turkish law forbade the use of the letters <em>Q</em>, <em>W</em>, and <em>X</em>
in official documents. This was part of a wider initiative to stifle
Kurdish cultureâ€”those letters occur in the language used by Kurdish
people but not in Istanbul Turkish.</p>

<p>As an exercise in doing ridiculous
things with technology, I&#8217;m asking you to program a text field (an
<code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> tag) that these letters cannot be typed into.</p>
<p>
(Do not worry about copy and paste and other such
loopholes.)</p>

<input type="text">
<script>
  var field = document.querySelector("input");
  field.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode == "Q".charCodeAt(0) ||
        event.keyCode == "W".charCodeAt(0) ||
        event.keyCode == "X".charCodeAt(0))
      event.preventDefault();
  });
</script>
